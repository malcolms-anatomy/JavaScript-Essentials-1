After completing Module 1, the student will:

    understand the fundamental programming concepts, such as: interpreting and the interpreter, compilation and the compiler, client-side vs. server-side programming;
    have basic knowledge of how to set up and use the basic programming environment (online or local);
    gain skills allowing them to run their first JavaScript program on the client side (both as an element embedded in the HTML page and directly in the browser console).
