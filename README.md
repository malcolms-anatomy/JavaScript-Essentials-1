# JavaScript-Essentials-1
Welcome to JavaScript Essentials 1

This course is the first in the JavaScript Essentials two-course series, and it will prepare you for the JSE â€“ Certified JavaScript Entry-Level Programmer certification exam.

The main goal of the course is to guide you from a state of complete programming illiteracy to a level of programming knowledge which allows you to design, write, debug, and run programs encoded in the JavaScript language, and to understand the basic concepts of software development technology.

The course will prepare you for jobs and careers connected with widely understood software development, which includes not only creating the code itself as a junior developer, but also computer systems design and software testing.
